                <p>I’m Stephanie Fiso, a UX/UI designer. I recently completed a 24-week UX/UI bootcamp where I learned many new skills that I am eager to put to work! I’ve always been interested in understanding why people do the things they do, and I find great satisfaction in creating enjoyable experiences for users. I particularly enjoy gathering user feedback and using that in my problem-solving process to create human-centered designs.</p>

                    <p>I take an objective approach to user research, making sure to let the user communicate their needs without being swayed by leading questions.</p>

                    <p>I feel strongly about incorporating user feedback into my design process to create human-centered designs. Creating empathy maps and user personas using data collected from user research helps me to understand and empathize with users.</p>
